-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Installation steps
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow these commands below which will install and setup the DAQ software:

$ cd Readout_Software/
$ source install.sh

This will perform the following steps:

    1) checkout the boost header files and place them in the
        Readout_Software/include/boost/ directory
        (using boost 1.60.0)
    2) build a shared library called libMyLib.so which is needed
        for linking the executable and allows for storing
        stl containers (vector<vector<>>) in ROOT
    3) calls qmake on vmmdcs.pro (which is under Readout_Software/build/)

At which point you should call make to compile the package (be sure to be
in Readout_Software/build/ to call this correctly) :

$ make 2>&1 |tee compile.log

At which point the vmmdcs executable will be located under Readout_Software/build.

The command to open up the DAQ window (called within Readout_Software/build/):
    > mac os:
        ./vmmdcs.app/Contents/MacOS/vmmdcs
    > linux:
        ./vmmdcs

The vmmdcs.pro file is set up to point to the include paths / dependencies based
on whether or not the system is linux or mac (mac being the only other considered
system other than linux). Currently the linux setup for these paths / deps.
is the PC used in the CERN June 2016 test beam and is running SLC 6 with gcc 4.7.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 System requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are the tested (and therefore highly recommended)
system requirements:

    > boost 1.60.0
    > Qt 5.4.2 (will not work with Qt >= 5.5)
    > ROOT 5.34 (will not work with ROOT 6)
    > c++11 abilities (gcc >= 4.7)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Getting the correct compiler setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are on a (CERN) machine running SLC6 and you require the correct gcc
(4.7 is the tested one) you can obtain this from CERN devtoolset:

http://linux.web.cern.ch/linux/devtoolset/

And the tested one is devtoolset-1.1:

yum install devtoolset-1.1

$ scl enable devtoolset-1.1 bash
$ gcc --version

Which should tell you that you are running with gcc 4.7.2.

Be sure that when you next open a shell or environment that when you call

$ gcc --version

it still says you are running gcc 4.7.2. If it does not, you may need to
add to your ~/.bashrc file the following line:

source /opt/rh/devtoolset-2/enable

or at least be sure to call this before compiling this package.

#Original name of this folder: vmm2dcs_1.1_noMon_qt5
#
#Designed with Qt 5.4 and ROOT 5.34/25.
#
#---------------------------
# To compile and run vmmdcs
#---------------------------
#
#First, build the shared library called libMylib.so, needed for linking the executable.
#
#> cd include
#> rootcint -f aDict.cxx -c a.h LinkDef.h
#> mkdir ../build/objects
#> g++ -o ../build/objects/libMylib.so aDict.cxx `root-config --cflags --libs` -shared -fPIC
#
#Install Qt and use qmake to generate a makefile:
#
#> cd ../build
#> ln -s objects/libMylib.so .
#> qmake -o Makefile executables.pro 
#
#On MacOS, if you installed binaries, you probably will need to specify the architecture.  Use:
#
#> qmake -spec macx-g++ -o Makefile executables.pro
#
#If qmake/Qt are not correctly added to your PATH, and/or if you compiled from source and are using an unusual installation location, you need to specify some locations, e.g.:
#
#> /Users/atlasmcgill/qt-4.8.5/bin/qmake -spec /Users/atlasmcgill/qt-4.8.5/mkspecs/macx-g++ -o Makefile executables.pro
#
#Compile:  
#
#> make
#
#Run:
#
#>./vmmdcs
#

#vmmconfig

#Configuration files can be found in the configs folder. They are XML files.

#vmmrun
