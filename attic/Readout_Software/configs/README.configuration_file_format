Description of the configuration file format for "vmmconfig".

The config file format that was chosen is the XML format, which is a structured text file using tags of various depth.

The file is divided into sections using header tags. Two sections (general.info and global.settings) hold general information. One section (channel.map) holds information contained originally in the Channels part of the main vmmdcs panel. A section (trigger.daq) is present as a placeholder for an eventual DAQ control parameters section. The other 64 sections hold the settings for each of the 64 channels of the VMM chip.  There is a series of mandatory items in each section, described below.

Items in each section are listed as one item per line, in the form:
<item.name>value</item.name>

Values can be strings or numbers (ints, floats, etc) and are entered in the same way as simple text.
_________________________________
I-UDP Setup

The <udp.setup> section is used to set the requested ports for the UDP communication in vmmconfig and vmmrun. It has the following mandatory fields:

fec.port: The FEC port number, used to bind the general purpose socket and receive replies.

daq.port: The DAQ port number, used to bind the socket for data streaming.

vmmasic.port: The VMMASIC port number.

vmmapp.port: The VMMAPP port number, used to send the configuration and trigger hex words.

s6.port: The s6 port number.

_________________________________
II-General info

The <general.info> section has the following mandatory fields:

config.version:  the version number of this configuration file, for bookkeeping.

vmm.id:  a unique identifier for the VMM chip this configuration file applies to. To give more than 1 VMM identifier, list them separated by ",".  

ip: the ip address of the VMM chip to send the configuration info to.  To give more than 1 ip address, list them separated by ",".  There must be an IP address for each vmm id and vice-versa.  The list of ip addresses is assumed to be in the same order as the list of vmm identifiers.


The General.Info section also has optional fields:

comment:  Holds user comments/notes on this configuration file.  IMPORTANT: Start and end with a double quote " " to ensure that the wwhole comment is treated as one long string 

debug: set to "on" to turn on debug messages, "off" to suppress.  If debug field is not listed in the config file, debug messages are off by default.

III-Trigger DAQ settings

The <trigger.daq> section contains Trigger DAQ parameters, currently held in vmmdcs. It has the following mandatory fields:

tp.decay: 

trigger.period: 

acq.sync: 

acq.window: 

run.mode: Type of run to be taken.  Allowed values are pulser and external. Note that the pulser is not active in external mode.

run.count: For a pulser run, number of pulses to send during the duration of the run.  Run will end after these pulses have been sent.  For an externally triggered run, duration of the run in seconds, no pulses are sent in external mode.

output.path: output directory full or relative path (optional, needed to write output to disk)

output.filename: name of the output raw data file (optional, needed to write output to disk)

__________________________________
IV-Channel Map 

The <channel.map> section holds the values needed to create the channel map, an essential part of the configuration hex word. It is composed of 8 sub-sections, called <hdmi.X>, where X=1..8. Each sub-section contains the three following fields:

switch: used to switch on or off the usage of the two following fields. Corresponds to hdmiX in vmmdcs.

first: corresponds to hdmiX_1 in vmmdcs.

second: corresponds to hdmiX_2 in vmmdcs. 

__________________________________
